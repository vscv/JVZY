Optical Character Recognition (OCR) [3] technology has also been greatly improved, so the digitization of document has reached the highest efficiency. However, since the texts of this period will have phonetic symbols annotated to facilitate pronunciation learning, the original OCR efficiency will be affected when these phonetic characters are digitized. So,  the essential premise is that there needs to be an appropriate number of phonetic symbol datasets for retraining the OCR model and training a phonetic symbols detector for image inpainting.
