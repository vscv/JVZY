# JVZY
## Joint-Vertic ZhuYin dataset for object detection and image inpainting

### 建立注音符號專用的深度模型訓練集，可供物件偵測模型對注音符號進行位置偵測，將取得之注音符號邊界框用於影像復原技術，即可將注音符號之區域抹除。

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) [3] technology has also been greatly improved, so the digitization of document has reached the highest efficiency. However, since the texts of this period will have phonetic symbols annotated to facilitate pronunciation learning, the original OCR efficiency will be affected when these phonetic characters are digitized. So,  the essential premise is that there needs to be an appropriate number of phonetic symbol datasets for retraining the OCR model and training a phonetic symbols detector for image inpainting.

  
  
  



# JVZYv2
## Joint-Variant ZhyYin dataset for Image-to-Image training

### 建立注音符號專用的深度模型訓練集，可供Image-to-Image模型的訓練，可將輸入影像中的注音符號直接抹除。
